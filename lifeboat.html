<div>
<p>Lifeboat is a marine weather app designed for boaters to check weather conditions.</p>
  <h4>My Role</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>UX/UI Designer</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Tools Used</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Adobe XD (Wireframes, Prototyping)</li>
      <li>Balsamiq (Wireframes)</li>
      <li>Optimal Workshop (Card Sorting)</li>
      <li>UsabilityHub (Preference Tests)</li>
      <li>Google Forms (User Surveys)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Boating enthusiasts need specific weather metrics that aren't found on every
    weather app. To determine what ocean conditions are like, they need to know swell
    height, tide times, wind direction, wind speed, and visibility.
    Current weather apps have one but not all the weather metrics boaters want.
    Boaters end up checking 2-4 sources to get all the information they need.</p>
  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>Boaters need a simple way to determine if weather conditions are safe on the ocean.
    We will know this to be true when users are checking the app when planning a boat
    excursion.</p>
  <h4>User Stories</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>As a boater, I want to see metrics like swell size and tides so I can determine
      when and where to go out on the boat.</li>
      <li>As a boater, I want a recommendation of ocean conditions.</li>
      <li>As a boater, I want to save a favorite location so I don’t have to re-type it each time.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>The User</h2>
    <h3>The Leisurely Retiree</h3>
      <p>Ages 60+</p>
      <p>“I am used to planning boat trips using old fashioned methods. I am open to try new
      apps if they aren’t too confusing for me.”</p>
      <h4>Behaviors</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Has more time to take long trips. Enjoys being spontaneous</li>
          <li>Checks the weather section while reading the newspaper and on his phone</li>
          <li>Desktop computer is his primary device</li>
          <li>Checks the weather at his starting point and destination</li>
          <li>Checks the weather 3 days in advance</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Frustrations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Finds crowded interfaces to be confusing</li>
          <li>Wants a recommendation so he doesn't have to comb through weather data</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>The Busy Boater</h3>
      <p>Ages 25-34</p>
      <p>“I like to plan ahead to pick the best day for boating. I check 3 apps to understand
      what the weather conditions will be.”</p>
      <h4>Behaviors</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Likes to plan ahead. Has less free time so wants his days on the ocean to be worth it</li>
          <li>Checks 3 different sources to find all the weather data he needs</li>
          <li>Checks the weather everyday in 1-2 minute sessions</li>
          <li>Checks the weather 7 days in advance</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Frustrations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Having to check multiple weather sources to get all the information he wants</li>
          <li>Each source has a different format. One has visualizations, one has metrics, and
          one has a written description</li>
        </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
    <div>
      <h4>Issue</h4>
      <p>Boaters are frustrated with having to check multiple weather sources to get all the
      information they need.</p>
      <h4>Brainstorm</h4>
      <p>Design a home page that takes a lot of information and makes it easy to read.
      Ensure all information boaters need is included.</p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>All pertinent information on the home page: temperature, precipitation, wind, swell
      height, visibility, tide times, and sun times.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Issue</h4>
      <p>Boaters want a recommendation rather than comb through weather data.</p>
      <h4>Brainstorm</h4>
      <p>Design a visual that gives a simple recommendation of how safe the ocean is. This
      way boaters can know ocean conditions at a glance.</p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>A safety meter that analyzes weather data and gives a safety rating.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Issue</h4>
      <p>Avid boaters have favorite spots they go to. They need an easy way to check the
      weather at their destinations.</p>
      <h4>Brainstorm</h4>
      <p>Create a way for boaters to check the weather at 2 spots: their starting point and
      destination.</p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>A trips section where users can check the weather at destinations and save favorite
      destinations.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>The Design</h3>
    <h4>The Site Map</h4>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/sitemap_desktop.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/sitemap_mobile.png" alt="Site Map">
      </picture>
      <p>Lifeboat is organized into 4 sections that users can switch between. Users interact
      with the app daily in short sessions and it is important that they can easily find
      information.</p>
      <p>The site map was revised after performing a card sorting exercise to understand
      how people categorized content. A key take away from card sorting was that users
      don’t categorize tide and sunset times with other weather data.</p>
    <h4>Usability Study</h4>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/issues.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/issues_mobile.png" alt="Usability Issues">
      </picture>
    <p>6 users participated in a study to identify pain points in the prototype. These issues
    were found and revisions were made in the following iteration.</p>
    <h4>The Design</h4>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/style_fonts.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/style_fonts_mobile.jpg" alt="Fonts">
      </picture>
    <p>Chakra Petch was chosen as the primary font because it is nautical and scientific. I
    was inspired to use orange by the color of lifeboats.</p>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/stlye_icons.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/style_icons_mobile.jpg" alt="Icons">
      </picture>
    <p>The orange filled icons accent blue and white that are used on the background and
    text.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>The Final Product</h3>
    <h4>Home Page</h4>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/home.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/home.png" alt="Home">
      </picture>
    <p>The main feature of the home page is the safety meter. A key takeaway from my
    initial user interviews, was that boaters want a summary of weather conditions so
    they don't have to comb through data. Ocean specific metrics are also available at a
    glance on the home page.</p>
    <h4>Weather</h4>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/weather_hourly.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/weather_hourly.png" alt="Weather">
      </picture>
    <p>Boaters check the weather everyday leading up to a boating excursion. The weather
    section gives users an hourly view of each weather metric. In the usability study, I
    tested a different hourly visual that looked like a clock. Feedback was mixed and I
    replaced it with a graph that is more digestible.</p>
    <h4>Trips</h4>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/trips.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/trips.png" alt="Trips">
      </picture>
    <p>Boaters check the weather in 2 places - their starting point and destination. The
    trips section allows users to see the weather at both places at once. Users can save
    favorite destinations.</p>
    <h4>Settings</h4>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/work/lifeboat/myprofile.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/work/lifeboat/myprofile.png" alt="Settings">
      </picture>
    <p>Boaters can save details about their boat and marina under settings. The starting
    location will default to the My Marina location. The safety meter's algorithm will take
    into consideration the type of boat when determining ocean safety.</p>
